NextCloud is a suite of client-server software for creating and using file hosting services. NextCloud is free and open-source, which means that anyone is allowed to install and operate it on their own private server devices.

With the integrated OnlyOffice, NextCloud application functionally is similar to Dropbox, Office 365 or Google Drive, but can be used on home-local computers or for off-premises file storage hosting.

The original OwnCloud developer Frank Karlitschek forked OwnCloud and created NextCloud, which continues to be actively developed by Karlitschek and other members of the original OwnCloud team.
