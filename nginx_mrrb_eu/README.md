Nginx (pronounced "engine X", /ˌɛndʒɪnˈɛks/ EN-jin-EKS), stylized as NGINX
or nginx or NginX, is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy,
load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache. The software was created by Igor
Sysoev and publicly released in 2004. Nginx is free and open-source
software, released under the terms of the 2-clause BSD license. A large
fraction of web servers use NGINX, often as a load balancer.
